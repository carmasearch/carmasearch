# Carma Search

Carma Search is a long-term platform to collect, normalize,
compare, and analyze vehicle data from multiple sources.

Core principles:

- Data accuracy over speed
- Backward compatibility is mandatory
- Services are isolated by responsibility
- APIs are contracts, not implementation details
- Comparisons must be deterministic

Non-goals:

- Scraping without normalization
- UI-driven business logic
- Tight coupling between services
